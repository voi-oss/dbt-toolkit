## Automations

### Documentation

* Propagates the documentation of columns that have the same name on downstream models, improving documentation
coverage while reducing manual repeated work

More information can be found on the package's [README](src/dbttoolkit/documentation/README.md).

### dbt Cloud artifacts

* Retrieve artifacts from a dbt Cloud project. Useful for building reports (such as test and documentation coverage)

More information can be found on the package's [README](src/dbttoolkit/dbt_cloud/README.md).

## Development

### Contributing

We are open and would love to have contributions, both in Pull Requests but also in ideas and feedback. Don't hesitate
to create an Issue on this repository if you are trying this project in your organization or have anything to share.

### Architecture

Groups of functionalities are encapsulated together in top-level packages, such as `dbt_cloud/` or `documentation/`.
Each package that exposes CLI commands should contain an `actions` sub-package. 

## Tests

More information can be found on the tests' [README](tests/README.md).

* Loosely follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
* Remember to prefix the tag name with `v`
* Use the tag name as the release title on GitHub
* Use the auto-generated release notes from GitHub
* Append a link at the end of the release notes to the released version on PyPI
